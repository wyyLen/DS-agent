        "task" : "file_name: abalone.csv. question: Explore the correlation between the length and the weight of the whole abalone. Additionally, perform feature engineering by creating a new feature called \"volume\" by multiplying the length, diameter, and height of the abalone. Determine if the volume feature improves the accuracy of predicting the number of rings using a linear regression model. constraints: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the strength and direction of the linear relationship between length and the weight. The volume feature should be created by multiplying the length, diameter, and height of the abalone. Use the sklearn's linear regression model to predict the number of rings. Split the data into a 70% train set and a 30% test set. Evaluate the models by calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE) with the test set."
